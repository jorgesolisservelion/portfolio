1,"AirBnB is a horrible, untrustworthy service. They only protect the host.  Do not use!  I booked a 1 month stay.  Two weeks into the stay i discovered, after being horribly I'll, that the apartment was rampant with mold.  I had already paid out of pocket for an ER visit plus medications, and had missed a lot of work.  AirBnB support decided to only refund the unspent nights and disregarded my other expenses.  I would have forgone the medical costs had they given a full refund for the apartment, but they refused.  Total disregard for personal health and safety!",2024-11-04T02:50:46.000Z
1,"We rented a beautiful villa in Ostuni Italy advertised on Airbnb by two separate hosts. It was listed as Manager Special by one place for for a reduced rate compared with the other and we decided to rent it for 5 nights, assuming they were switching management companies.   Several days prior to leaving, I contacted Airbnb customer support to confirm our reservation beacause I did not receive the address or phone to contact our host. They replied with a fake city center coordinate and fake phone number so when we got to Italy, we had no place to go. Our current host managed to contacted the actual host  and received the address, but when we arrived at the property, they claimed they did not receive payment from Airbnb and if we wanted to stay, we needed to pay again. The cost was over $1500 more than the contracted price we paid online and Airbnb refused to refund the difference. I believe we were scammed and would never trust Airbnb site again. Buyer beware!",2024-11-04T05:34:12.000Z
1,"Taylor Swift concert attendees beware !! Airbnb hosts are confirming reservations to make their listing unavailable on the site. Then list the property privately for 10-20 times normal rates. When the confirmed Airbnb renter arrives to check in there is no key and they can’t check in. Airbnb does nothing to help . This happened to my daughters in Indianapolis. Airbnb terms of service states they will assist with alternate accommodation. They offered a refund in the form of a coupon for the next trip. Who would be stupid enough to use them again ? I told them to give the coupon to the person next to them because where it needs to go it should be shoulder depth at the least . I’m going to get busy on creating a site to review businesses that can get 1-5 star reviews and s**t stains like Airbnb can get multiple negative stars to reflect the actual rating they deserve. I feel nauseous giving them 1 star. I can use stars for mediocre to great and anything below zero measured in balloon knots. Up to 5 stars like normal, unlimited balloon knots.",2024-11-04T03:37:39.000Z
1,I booked a place for two nights for $350 and had to cancel two hours later due to unforeseen circumstances. Was issued a partial refund of $148. Next morning after my issue was resolved contacted the host to see if I can continue with the booking as it was still available and pay the partial refund amount as the host had kept $200 already. Had no response at all from the host. Contacted Airbnb customer service who after contacting the host advised that they could not help and if I wanted to book the place would need to pay the full price again meaning it would cost me another 350 on top of the 200 he already kept!!! Think it's legalised extortion. Airbnb took the side of the host. Have used the platform a number of times but will never use again,2024-11-03T05:39:21.000Z
1,"Airbnb is absolute TRASH. We stayed at a host property in Hollywood in February 2024. Today, Nov. 2nd, 2024, 9 months later, I get a message from Airbnb threatening to suspend my account accusing me of using the threat of a negative review to manipulate a host! WTAF?? No, I left a bad review because the place was a sh*thole and the stay was horrific! I had ZERO correspondence with the host about my review nor did I ever threaten the host. I asked Airbnb for evidence if they are going to accuse me of something and nothing but crickets. There are other options. Airbnb, you don't have to ""suspend my account"" because I will never use you again. Take your threats and shove it. VBRO has better properties anyway.",2024-11-02T10:55:23.000Z
1,"Awful platform as a host.Somehow I am rated a Super Host but this is nonsense AirBnB treat me awful. First of all every time someone stays they charge both guests and myself separate admin fees.However what's really upset me is sometimes bookings are automated and sometimes I have to approve. Seems random. Anyway today a booking automated and within an hour I tried to cancel as I was double booked and AirBnB actually charged me 50% of what was paid by the guest as a punishment for the cancellation. This is petty dictatorship type behaviour. I have asked to have my Super Host status removed as I don't want to be associated with AirBnB anymore and I'll cancel my account once all bookings complete.Honestly, if you are a host, don't bother.",2024-10-31T23:35:49.000Z

1,"Our stay was enjoyable until we encountered an unfounded claim from the host regarding supposed damage to the toilet pump. We used only the toilet paper provided, flushed nothing inappropriate, and ensured all other items (like makeup wipes) were disposed of in the trash. The pump was never clogged or malfunctioned at any point during our stay.Now, the host is demanding $480 for a repair we did not cause, attempting to hold us responsible for what appears to be pre-existing damage. This experience has left us feeling unfairly accused and frustrated by the lack of integrity in the claims. We do not recommend staying here if you expect transparency and fairness. This took place at 647 New London Rd. Newark, DE.",2024-10-31T02:57:12.000Z
1,"Our stay started off well, but it quickly turned sour due to an unfounded accusation by the host regarding alleged damage to the toilet pump. We used only the toilet paper provided, flushing nothing else, and disposed of other items, like makeup wipes, properly in the trash. The pump was functioning without issue during our stay, and the photo we were sent afterward clearly showed signs of pre-existing damage.Despite this, the host is demanding $480 for a repair we did not cause. The situation has left us feeling not only unfairly accused but also as though we were racially profiled. As respectful guests who take care to treat every property with respect, this experience was extremely disappointing and upsetting. We would not recommend this property to anyone who expects to be treated fairly and without bias. This took place at 647 New London Rd, Newark,DE!",2024-10-31T03:01:03.000Z
1,"I am a host on AIRBNB. I have had problems with my calendar opening itself up to guests at season-low rates after I blocked specific dates for season-high rates. I have called and complained to customer service numerous times, each time allowing guests to keep their reservations except for one. This guest booked during December in Hawaii at a very low rate. AIRBNB complied with my request to cancel their reservation. However, they charged me a $200.00 cancellation fee and removed me as a Super Host. I called customer service (AGAIN) to complain about the cancellation fee. Now AIRBNB has blocked my calendar altogether. We have stopped getting bookings for this unit since I asked them to cancel the unauthorized reservation. Also, every time I unblock the calendar, it automatically blocks entire calendar for 2024 -2025 and beyond. I have since started an account with VRBO but because I synced my calendar, AIRBNB is blocking potential bookings on VRBO and their affiliate sites.",2024-11-03T05:37:03.000Z
1,"I’d give them zero stars if this platform would permit it.I’m going to be guarded about how much is disclosed here given the possibility that we may commence legal proceedings against AirBnB and or the host.Unsafe electrical supply, two middle aged people basically made homeless in a foreign country and our account deleted in an attempt to cut us off from complaining.We were also charged over 50% of the original fee for 2 out of the 7 nights booked.Time to make some noise!",2024-10-28T18:10:22.000Z
1,"We recently stayed in an AIRBNB that was unsanitary, unclean, and had no top sheets.  The owner also lied about the mattress quality.  We were forced to leave after one night and the owner did not offer to fix the problem or give us even a partial refund.   We paid for 5 nights - about $800.  I have a bad back and ask the owner/host specific questions about the mattress BEFORE BOOKING and he lied.  Just as bad, AIRBNB did not help at all.  All we ask for was a partial refund.   They completely sided with the HOST even though he lied and admitted to unsanitary conditions.   People please be aware that AIRBNB will likely side with the HOST, since they get a percentage of the rental fee.  Also, help others and complain.  If you SEE something wrong, say Something in your review!  Thank You.",2024-11-01T22:30:06.000Z
1,"An abusive company and their only concern is to earn money. Up till today I had completely a different impression but today I see that some ambassadors are not being neutral, they are protecting one party other than being a neutral mediator. I have asked them to cancel my booking and they didn’t! I ended up paying a fortune, for a flat that I didn’t even stay! I feel abused, I feel my time and money is stolen! For two days now I am waiting for them to resolve a problem created by them! I am a super host and I unlisted my listing right away. If they are treating me like a host, I don’t want risking my guests being treated by them as I was treated. I am deleting the app and I will stick to using other apps such as booking,reserving etc. If you have self respect,please do something good for yourself and avoid booking on this company.",2024-10-30T22:30:43.000Z

1,Airbnb turned my house into a clandestine ** lab and does not want to take responsibility for it. I have been out of my house for more than a year. The house was shut down by the county and the fbi is involved looking for suspects. I asked them for help since they have a “million dollar insurance” and they don't want to help me!! I attached an e-mail of their response when I asked for help to get my house back to liveable conditions. They said it was not under their terms.,2024-10-31T03:12:33.000Z
3,"Not a ding for the actual Airbnb app, but a ding for the treatment by the owner after the stay. We stayed in a beautiful home in NOLA for a week. No issues with the home itself, but after leaving the home, (we stayed at a hotel for 2 days after while still in town), I inadvertantly left behind property  in a bedroom drawer (Samsung Pixel earpods, portable cellphone charger, RayBan prescription eyeglasses, RayBan sunglasses). Owner would not let us return to the home to collect items becuase it was already occupied? They first said they did not find any proeprty, and then claimed they only found the eyeglasses which I had to describe, and said it would  cost $100 to mail them back to me in California. I understand it was my mistake for leaving property behind, but there is no way the home was occupied 2 hours after we left. I have a relative who said she would go pick up the items for me and at first the owner said yes, then a couple of days later (they would not respond to text messages or phone calls) said no because it was a security risk and they could only mail them to me. I know they took the missing items and It will cost me hundreds of dollars to replace everything but lesson learned, keep everything in my suitcase from now on!! So angry!",2024-11-01T18:58:22.000Z
1,"The worst service I have ever received from a company. We hosted for 3 years through this service making Air BnB thousands of dollars, they never backed us up when guests just used their review system to get out of pay for damages and when you use their so-called $1m cover, they bargain you down on the cost of the damages without any course to rebut. horrible experience and would not host with them again, I hope with this kind of customer service they go broke.",2024-10-29T13:57:27.000Z

Clearly the whole reporting system is broken if that's the case, and I should never waste my time doing reviews again, and my personal crop of guest reviews recorded, that a host might check, is positive. Airbnb are fools in letting people's reluctance to give criticism meaning that good is bad. Writing a nuanced review is hard, and clearly pointless if only the numbers matter.",2024-10-25T12:23:00.000Z
1,"On most occasions when things go wrong with their web booking system, Airbnb have treated us, their host customers, with contempt, indifference and disrespect. If you have a problem caused by their not-fit-for-purpose software, they will go to great lengths to gaslight you and prevent you getting through to a technical person who might be able to correct the issue quickly, in the hope that you will give up. They go to the ends of the world to prevent you from communicating directly with the customer. They intimidate you by treatening to withold YOUR money if you dont send them a photocopy of your passport. They take days to resolve software/ synchronisation issues with your Channel Manager-Eviivo, in our case. They always say its Eviivo's fault, whether it is or not, and some don""t even offer the most basic advice.Most don't offer to help, and dont phone back when they say they will. This week, they sent 2 groups of guests to the same chalet and their messaging software had de-synched from ours. Told us it was our fault. Eviivo got them to fix things amd sent us a link.Now  their software has shown both chalets unavailable till 22 Nov but 1is vacant. Been waitin 3 days for them to fix that. Ongoing.......We are on many website but our advice to anyone just wanting just1 Online Travel Agent is to avoid Airbnb like the plague, they will have you tearing your hair out with fristration!

Got to a property full of cockroaches that hadn't been cleaned and the team at AirBnB abandoned us for the night saying they had to ""mediate"" with the host, whilst fully aware we had nowhere to sleep. No help whatsoever, pathetic compensation and I'm now out of pocket for an inadequate property they happily continue to display on their platform. Interestingly, any negative reviews can be avoided by hosts as they will simply refuse to write one for those staying, meaning that when they know people will not be rightly complimentary about a property, they can just do nothing. Terrible customer service, questionable properties.  Never again.",2024-10-26T15:22:41.000Z

I booked a house that apparently had no heating, it was hidden under “Amenities” and not clearly stated in the description which talked about everything including No Pets Allowed but could not dedicate space to not having heat. It was going to drop to freezing during my stay and that was just not an option. People die from hypothermia. When I tried to cancel, the management wouldn’t return me a full refund. Airbnb subsequently refused to help either. Heat and the survival of its customers is clearly not a basic requirement. Before you book anything through Airbnb make sure you ask the right questions, is there heat, running water, potable water, flush toilets, no pests, etc. because don’t take it for granted.

Right after the payment, the scammer host messages me telling me that the dates don’t suit him and that I should cancel. I tell him that I can’t cancel because I won’t get refunded but that he should cancel on his end. He refused to cancel because he wants me to so that he can pocket the money and then open the reservations again to be paid double. Airbnb is NOT helpful and not responsive.

One major issue is the overpriced cleaning fees, which often make what initially seems like an affordable stay much more expensive.

If Airbnb can address this and ensure more reasonable fees, it would be a much better experience for customers.",2024-10-10T14:02:43.000Z

They just decided that the portion I had paid was the 50% unpaid. That being said- this is not the first time. Airbnb hosts will burn you and rip you off ANY TIME they have the opportunity. If you use this service your trip must be solid and everything must be left as if you were never there- bed made and all.

After booking a month-long apartment in Nottingham, I arrived to find a filthy, dilapidated space that bore no resemblance to the advertised photos. When I contacted Airbnb's customer service, they were dismissive and insisted I reach out to the landlord directly.The landlord promised to send someone to clean and contact me with an update, but I never heard from him again. Upon returning to the apartment, I found it still to be in a disgusting state, with the bathroom being particularly appalling.I reported the issue to Airbnb multiple times, but their response was always the same: they would 'look into it' and get back to me. Frustrated and out of options, I was forced to book a hotel room. Despite providing video evidence that the apartment was not as advertised, Airbnb refused to issue a refund.This experience has made me wary of using Airbnb in the future.

We booked a private home to spend our wedding eve and day and night in, with our immediate families. The home looked fabulous on the advert, It was failed to mention it was a functioning bed & breakfast, with cameras inside the dining room and the owners living behind adjoining doors marked 'private'. my phone number was given to numerous people without my consent who contacted me. our conversations were overheard and even to the point I was contacted regarding an issue we had not even discussed with the 'host' 'owner'. Airbnb are so obstructive, they want the customer to prove the faults via photo when in reality all we wanted to do with our families was get out of there. I will never ever use this 'organization' again. it is a scheme set up to rip people off and not take accountability, for the lack of information in hosts adverts and transparency in the rules of the home, which the hosts can change at the drop of the hat.

Do not rent through Airbnb unless you want trouble and not support from this platform. You provide a 5* experience for all guests but every now and then you get terrible guests who make up lies and trash the house and then claim refunds. The airbnb team always rule in favour of the guests and you don’t even get a chance to counter or see any “evidence” they provide. It’s outrageous. The worst part is they do not even tell you that deductions will be made or give any communication to this affect so you are essentially financially harmed at a random future date. It’s unacceptable when this income supports hosts lives and we haven’t done a thing wrong but provide excellent accommodation and adhere to standards. There is no wonder people are not hosting here anymore. Avoid.,2024-10-14T17:48:04.000Z

1,"I had a frustrating experience with Airbnb that led to my account being restricted because of issues with guest capacity and payment processing. I tried to book a stay, carefully adding both overnight guests and visitors within the maximum limit the app allowed. However, the app didn’t provide any warning or indication that including visitors might cause a problem. I assumed everything was fine since the booking system accepted my input.Things got worse when my payment was declined without a clear explanation, and shortly after, my account was restricted without notice. It felt unfair since the app’s lack of clarity misled me into thinking my booking was in compliance. The absence of helpful error messages or warnings made it impossible to address the issue before Airbnb took action.Airbnb really needs to improve its guest management system and provide better real-time notifications for errors. Users should be warned about potential violations upfront, and payment errors should be explained clearly. Until they fix these issues, I can’t recommend the app—it’s too easy for small misunderstandings to lead to big headaches.",2024-10-23T22:30:28.000Z

Not knowing what to expect I was open minded and expected some teething difficulties.I can honestly say it’s been the best thing I have done in ages.It’s enabled me to stay in my beautiful home now I am widowed, and I have thoroughly enjoyed meeting some truly wonderful people.Maybe I am the lucky one but 95% of my guests have been lovely, the few that have caused damage have been dealt with promptly and fairly by Airbnb.I feel supported and secure in the knowledge that there’s always someone there to talk to.It’s a massive thumbs up from me, Thank you",2024-10-09T16:42:37.000Z

Was contacted by the very rude Marguerite (17 rue des Rec******, 75010 Paris) who agreed to refund the hotel if I left a 5 star review and would only pay after I could no longer amend my review. I advised Airbnb that the host was trying to manipulate me but they decided to side with the owner despite me sending photos and keeping them advised of what I was doing,  so I ended up paying for the hotel and also the apartment for that night and Airbnb kept the property on their website as the owner was more valuable to their business than I was.

1,"I have a Single-Family Home set up for short-term rental. I thought I would add Airbnb to help improve my rentals. This was a disaster. The directions are terrible. I tried to do everything they said to do. They sent me a message that said it would take up to 10 days to approve my application. Then, the next day, they rented my home in February without even consulting me at a price half of what I get for in-season rentals. I have already rented for almost twice the price they set for that period. The price was set for off-season rental rates. If that was not bad enough when I contacted them they blamed me for not knowing how their terrible programs work. No customer care. They wanted to charge me $50 plus 10% of the rent.  Sorry, I am not going to let a big corporation push me around.  If you do business with them be careful all they want to do is use your property like a prostitute. They do not care about the owner of the property. When I talked with them they blamed it on third party. (someone in the bask office said bla bla)",2024-10-23T18:27:49.000Z

1,"Airbnb's high booking fees are a bitter pill to swallow, especially when their support system proves unhelpful. Our recent stay turned into a nightmare when the apartment we rented lost power for two entire days. Despite our immediate appeal to Airbnb, their response was more platitude than problem-solving.We were left in the dark, literally and figuratively, without basic amenities like Wi-Fi, heat, or refrigeration. The experience was nothing short of a disaster. To add insult to injury, Airbnb refused our request for a partial refund, even for just one of the days without electricity. Their lack of empathy and support is a stark reminder that when things go wrong, you're essentially on your own.If you're considering Airbnb, be prepared for the possibility of encountering issues and receiving little to no assistance.",2024-10-19T20:19:54.000Z
5,"We booked a villa in Corfu at fairly short notice via the air bnb website (2 days before). The villa was supplied via Hestia travel Corfu, on it’s list of amenities was flat screen TV and free internet throughout. We arrived at a cute little villa with a pool, albeit rather remote in the hills.  Unfortunately, this is when the issue became apparent - there was no usable Internet with initially download & upload speeds of only 0.75 MB/s and 0 MB/s respectively measured at the router using the accepted Ookla international standard.  This only ‘increased’ to 1.3 MB/s and zero, respectively on rebooting.  This was too slow to support the advertised Smart TV streaming Netflix and impossible to send even basic messages!  We had to drive to a Taverna to borrow a phone to message the ‘host’ Georgios of Hestia Travel Corfu.In fairness, he arrived promptly BUT was passive aggressive from the outset stating “the property has WiFi but just not fast WiFi” - but look at these speeds!  He didn’t call the ISP for advice or arrange an engineer (but in truth really needed to spend some money on a decent data package).  Rather, he pretended to accept the cancellation and agree a refund as we had to find alternative accom and then barely an hour later, denied  it despite the evidence.  Airbnb were brilliant and managed the full refund (of which to date Hestia Travel has only offered two nights refund despite Airbnb upholding our complaint based on the attached evidence rather than the host’s unfounded comment since he had zero evidence).

So I called the host from Love On Balluta Bay Beach - Apartment and explained the situation and told him that will arrive 2 days later. But initially asked me to cancel the booking but said he will accommodate us. But he lied and a few hours before travelling we had to get even more stress and had to call Airbnb multiple times to help us find a resolution. Airbnb only gave us half of the money which was paid and the rest was stolen by the host. The people from Airbnb said they will fine the host who was a scammer but nothing happened.

Passing residents told us this has been broken for months and that it won't be fixed for a few more weeks. So not wanting to lug the stroller and bags up and down 6 flights of stairs every time we come and go we had to cancel the booking. Contacted the Airbnb who said they would contact the host and then get back to me. Given it was late at night (9pm) you'd think they'd call back soon, especially with a crying baby in the background. I call them back 30m later and am told that they will help with a refund only and I need to do another booking. Now booking last minute hotel late at night ended up costing us more than double than if we'd booked the hotel in the first place and Airbnb never got back to me again. So I was left late at night with a cryinging baby and no place to stay, made to pay more than double for a hotel.

It’s beyond concerning that they allow the listing to remain on their site, along with protecting the falsely advertised homes and not their customers safety.",2024-10-05T02:56:50.000Z
1,"Great if everything goes according to the planBUTAs a guest and a super host, I have experienced appalling customer service if the accommodation is not as described or when guests damage my property.Airbnb insist on hiring cheap low-calibre staff in countries where the workers can't afford to travel to Europe.I was once awarded £35 to get professional carpet cleaners to clean a soiled carpet. This shows how clueless the staff are about the cost of living in London.",2024-09-24T14:30:33.000Z
1,Have been a host and so disapointing with the poorly skilled administration team and broken leadership.We have a claim regarding a missing remote control and they’ve actually requested a photo of the missing item.It’s a massive money grab with poor back end processes and incredibly unprofessional with unskilled staff.,2024-10-07T00:27:52.000Z
